## beginnings

`A good workman is known by his tools`

Rule 1: Think before you program! </br>
Rule 2: A program is a human-readable essay on problem solving that also happens to execute on a computer.</br>
Rule 3: The best way to improve your programming and problem skills is to practice!</br>

Here are some useful guidelines of writing comments</br>
```
The why phillsophy: Good comments don't repeat the code or explain it. They clarify its intent. Comments should explain, at a higher level of abstraction than the code,what you're trying to do.

The how philosophy: If your code contains a novel or noteworthy solution, add comments to explain the methodology.

functions</br>
```
print()
input()
id()
type()
help()
```

python中10进制整数，不能以0开头。0o表示8进制数，0x表示16进制数，0b表示2进制数。</br>

It is important to remember that floating-point values are apporximate values, not exact, and that operations using floating-point values yield approximate values, not exact, and that operations using floating-point values yield approximate values. Integers are exact, and operations on integers yield exact values.</br>

Python does provide a module called the decimal module that provides more predicatable, and controllable, results for floating-point numbers.</br>

Finally, unlike integers in Python, a leading 0 on a floating-point number carries no significance: 012. is equivalent to 12.0</br>

`/` division the result will be float</br>
`//` quotient If the operation has integer operands, the quotient is integer, if the operation has floating-point operands, the result is float.</br>

```
import math
math.sin
math.cos
math.pow
math.sqrt
math.hypot Takes two numeric arguments, x and y, and returns sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2), the Euclidean distance.
math.fabs
