# awesome year17

Plans for year 2017

```
Mathematics won the war. 
Mathematics broke the Japanese codes and built the A-bomb. 
Mathematics like you.
The stated goal of the Soviets is global communism. 
In medicine or ecomics, in technology or space,
battle lines are being drawn. 
To triumph we need results. Publishable applicable results. 
Now who among you will be the next Morse? The next Einstein? 
Who among you will be the vanguard of democracy freedom and discovery? 
Today we bequeath America's future into your able hands. 
Welcome to Princeton gentlemen.
